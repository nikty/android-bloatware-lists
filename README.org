* Objectives

- Never brick your phone.
- Do not uninstall apps that are not immediately recognized as bloatware.
- Do not attempt to be a security expert (we are not).
- Consider uninstalling Google Play and using F-Droid instead: https://f-droid.org

* Contributing

Please consider adding any missing apps.
