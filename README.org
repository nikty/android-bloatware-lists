#+TITLE: Lists of Android (bloatware) apps

This is an attempt to categorize bloatware apps that are installed on
Android phones.

Based on [[https://github.com/Universal-Debloater-Alliance/universal-android-debloater-next-generation][UAD-ng]].

* Objectives

- Never brick your phone.
- Do not uninstall apps that are not immediately recognized as bloatware.
- Do not attempt to be a security expert (we are not).
- Consider uninstalling Google Play and using F-Droid instead: https://f-droid.org

* File organization and naming conventions

The lists are in YAML files inside [./bloatware/](./bloatware) directory.

Most YAML files are named using the first two elements of the Android app ID.

* Contributing

Please consider adding any missing apps.

1. Check if app is listed in this repository
   #+begin_src
     $ grep -r APP_ID .
   #+end_src
2. Add package entry to appropriate file in following format:
   #+begin_src yaml
     - id: APP_ID
       description: |
         Describe what this package does.
       removal: recommended # If this app is obviously not needed.
   #+end_src
