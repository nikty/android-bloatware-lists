    Mobicore is now Trustonic
    Trustonic is a small OS running on the CPU providing a TEE, an isolated environment that runs in parallel with the operating system, guaranteeing code and data loaded inside to be protected.
    Sounds great, but it's closed source and "normal" devs can't use it for their apps.
    See "com.trustonic.tuiservice"
