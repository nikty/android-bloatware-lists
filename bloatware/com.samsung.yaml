    Always On Display
    NOTE: This package handles the clock on the lockscreen, in addition to the AOD functionality.
    When enabled in settings it shows clock and notifications when you raise the phone or touch the screen.
    This is basically a lower-power lock-screen. It could in theory reduce power draw if you check notifications/clock often as OLED screens draw minimal power showing a mostly black screen(black = pixel off), but in practice the number of times you'll unintentionally trigger it will likely eat up any potential power savings and more. And if your device doesn't have an OLED screen this will draw way more power.
    Most of these power savings could be applied to your standard lock-screen simply by making your background image completely black.

    IPSGeofence
    IPS = Indoor Positioning System.
    The concept of Indoor Positioning System designates a network of connected devices within a building making it possible to trace the position of another device – and therefore potentially of a person – in environments where GPS systems are 
    not efficient .
    Geofencing is a technique which consists in activating preconfigured actions when a device enters a certain geographical area.
    For example, a user can use it to automatically turn on Wi-Fi and home lights when their smartphone is detected nearby.
    In short, if enabled, this app will track your location everywhere and all the time!

    Checks the validity of your KLM/KPE (Knox Licence Manager) license.
    This package is needed for Samsung Health (`com.sec.android.app.shealth`) and probably all Knox-related apps (like Secure Folder, Samsung Pay...)
    
    Note: KLM licences are deprecated. Samsung now only supports KPE (Knox Platform for Enterprise) keys.
    KPE keys are provided by Samsung and enable app's developers to access knox features.

    Knox Key Chain
    Allows apps to sign data using system-wide private key/certificate pairs. 
    So, even though the Android Keystore provides per-app access to credentials, the Android KeyChain runs as a system user, 
    and hence, credentials stored through the Android KeyChain are associated with the system ID instead of a user ID.
    https://docs.samsungknox.com/dev/knox-sdk/about-keystores.htm
    This is only useful for apps using the TIMA Keystore. The big question I'm trying to answer is:
    Which are using this except Samsung apps? Can an android dev help on this?

    RCS (Rich Communication Services)
    Has permissions linked to com.samsung.cmh, and com.samsung.android.visionintelligence (and I don't understand why).
    RCS is a communication protocol between mobile telephone carriers and between phone and carrier, aiming at replacing SMS.
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Communication_Services
    Uses IP protocol, so it needs an internet connection.
    It's a hot mess right now. It aims at being universal but only exists in Samsung Messages and Google Messages, because Google hasn't released a public API yet, so 3rd-party apps can't support it.
    In a lot of countries messages go through Google's Jibe servers.
