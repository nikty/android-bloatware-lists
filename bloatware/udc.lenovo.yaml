    Another Mobile Device Management (MDM) allows companyâ€™s IT department to reach inside your phone in the background, allowing them to ensure
    your device is secure, know where it is, and remotely erase your data if the phone is stolen.
    It's a way to ensure employees stay productive and do not breach corporate policies
    You should NEVER have a MDM tool on your personal phone.
