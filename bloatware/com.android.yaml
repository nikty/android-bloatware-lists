    This package is a generic solution that allows carriers to indicate when a device has run OOB(Out Of Balance). Android devices that are OOB need carrier mitigation protocols to allow select data through(like to notify users their data/balance is out, or allow them to buy more data through the carrier app).
    Will probably break that functionality if disabled, but is otherwise safe to disable(should only affect users that are out of data/balance?).

    Overlays work by mapping resources defined in the overlay package to resources defined in the target package. When an app attempts to resolve the value of a resource in the target package, the value of the overlay resource the target resource is mapped to is returned instead.
    Safety Center provides redirection entries so that users can access specific security and privacy settings. Safety Center also identifies issues that users can fix on their devices or accounts, by combining dynamic data received from multiple sources. This data provides users with a general safety status with specific recommendations.

    Wallpaper Backup
    Backs up and restores wallpaper and metadata related to it.
    This agent has its own package because it does full backup as opposed to SystemBackupAgent which does key/value backup.
    This class stages wallpaper files for backup by copying them into its own directory because of the following reasons:
    Non-system users don't have permission to read the directory that the system stores the wallpaper files in
    BackupAgent enforces that backed up files must live inside the package's getFilesDir()
    There are 3 files to back up:
    The "wallpaper info"  file which contains metadata like the crop applied to the wallpaper or the live wallpaper component name.
    The "system" wallpaper file.
    An optional "lock" wallpaper, which is shown on the lockscreen instead of the system wallpaper if set.
    On restore, the metadata file is parsed and WallpaperManager APIs are used to set the wallpaper.
    Note that if there's a live wallpaper, the live wallpaper package name will be part of the metadata file and the wallpaper will be applied when the package it's installed.

    A runtime resource overlay (RRO) is a package that changes the resource values of a target package at runtime. For example, an app installed on the system image might change its behavior based upon the value of a resource. Rather than hardcoding the resource value at build time, an RRO installed on a different partition can change the values of the app's resources at runtime.
    RROs can be enabled or disabled. You can programmatically set the enable/disable state to toggle an RRO's ability to change resource values. RROs are disabled by default (however, static RROs are enabled by default).
