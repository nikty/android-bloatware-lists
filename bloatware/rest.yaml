    omacp = OMA Client Provisioning. It is a protocol specified by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA).
    Configuration messages parser. Used for provisioning APN settings to Samsung devices via SMS 
    In my case, it was automatic and I never needed configuration messages.
    Maybe it's useful if carriers change their APN. But you still can change the config manually, it's not difficult.
    Keep in mind these special types of SMS can be abused (though you would need to select to apply the APN in the popup):
