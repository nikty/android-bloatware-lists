    Qualcomm Connectivity Engine
    Enables seamless hand-off between mobile data and Wi-Fi networks. Can also dynamically measure network performance to prioritize using the best one (I think that's part of "Intelligently select the best Wi-Fi" in settings).
    Probably worth keeping on; I noticed connection reliability getting worse when I disabled it.

    Qualcomm Voice Assist (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.quicinc.voice.activation)
    Always-on voice detection, so obviously always runs in the background.
    Probably worth keeping enabled for battery savings if you use Google Assistant regularly while your screen is off.
