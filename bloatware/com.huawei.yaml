    Always On Display
    When enabled in settings it shows clock and notifications when you raise the phone or touch the screen.
    This is basically a lower-power lock-screen. It could in theory reduce power draw if you check notifications/clock often as OLED screens draw minimal power showing a mostly black screen(black = pixel off), but in practice the number of times you'll unintentionally trigger it will likely eat up any potential power savings and more. And if your device doesn't have an OLED screen this will draw way more power.
    Most of these power savings could be applied to your standard lock-screen simply by making your background image completely black.

    Location Based Services
    Location-based services (LBS) are applications or services that utilize location data from a user's device, such as a smartphone or GPS, to provide relevant information, directions, or recommendations tailored to their specific location. These services rely on a combination of technologies, including Global Positioning System (GPS), Wi-Fi, cellular networks, and sensors, to determine a user's position accurately.
    NOTE: Can cause bootloops on some devices.
    The primary goal of LBS is to offer personalized and context-aware experiences based on a user's geographical location. This can include services like:
    1. Navigation and Mapping, 2. Location-Based Advertising, 3. Social Networking, 4. Emergency Services, 5. IoT Asset Tracking

    Task killer app in EMUI 9+ (Android 9+).
    Task killer apps tend to do more harm than help as they clear cached RAM for no good reason, removing the battery and time savings involved in caching. In addition to the obvious issues with background functionality like notifications.
    From issue#104.
    System will start lagging a little bit (you will notice it while scrolling and on some animations, for example scrolling installed apps), battery consumption will become slightly higher and battery stats will disappear soon. At the same time, logcat will be full of errors like: PowerKit: PG Server is not found. calling pid xxxx.
