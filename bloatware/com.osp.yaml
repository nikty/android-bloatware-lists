    Samsung Account app
    Lots of trackers in this app.
    Has a huge list of permissions. It is an essential app for a lot of samsung apps (which will be removed with the default selection in this list)
    Settings app will crash if removed on Android 11/OneUI 3.0+ (https://gitlab.com/W1nst0n/universal-android-debloater/-/issues/39)
    This issue happens only if you are running Android 11. If not, you can can (and should) remove this package!
  id: com.osp.app.signin
  removal: advanced
