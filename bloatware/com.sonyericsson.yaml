    omacp = OMA Client Provisioning. It is a protocol specified by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA).
    It is used by carrier to send "configuration SMS" which can setup network settings (such as APN).
    In my case, it was automatic and I never needed configuration messages. I'm pretty sure that in France this package is useless.
    Maybe it's useful if carriers change their APN... but you still can change it manually, it's not difficult.
    These special "configuration SMS" can be abused :

    Backup/Restore Sony feature.
    Enables you to backup contacts, call logs, text messages, calendar, settings, bookmarks & media files.
    NOTE: I don't think this feature can backup your messages or calendars for instance if you don't use the Sony stock app.

    Startup Flag Service
    Used during the production of the phone to verify that the touch input works. 
    It can be triggered when a specific TA-parameter is not set. This should never be triggered and if it does well it doesn't have any use for you.
    
    TA means Timing Advance and its value correspond to the length of time a signal takes to reach the base station from a mobile phone.

    WAP Push
    Used to display annoying WAP push.
    WAP push is a type of text message that contains a direct link to a particular Web page. 
    When a user is sent a WAP-push message, he receives an alert, once clicked, directs him to the Web page via his browser.
    Personally, I don't like this. URLs are now recognized by the SMS instant messaging apps and you just have to click on it.
