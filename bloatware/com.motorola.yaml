    Virtual UICC Payment
    SIM Card Payment also NFC. Only useful in China by hidden image files.
    UICC stands for Universal Integrated Circuit Card.
    It is the physical and logical platform for the USIM and may contain additional USIMs and other applications.
    (U)SIM is an application on the UICC.
    https://bluesecblog.wordpress.com/2016/11/18/uicc-sim-usim/
    I guess this package provides support for NFC payments.
    Note: The term SIM is widely used to refer to both SIMs and UICCs in the industry and among consumers.

    OMA Client Provisioning
    It is a protocol specified by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA).
    It is used by carrier to send "configuration SMS" which can setup network settings (such as APN).
    In my case, it was automatic and I never needed configuration messages. I'm pretty sure that in France this package is useless.
    Maybe it's useful if carriers change their APN... but you still can change it manually, it's not difficult.

    Carrier Provisioning Service
    Provisioning involves the process of preparing and equipping a network to allow it to provide new services to its users.
    OMADM  = OMA Device Management
    Basically, it handles configuration of the device (including first time use), enabling and disabling features provided by carriers.
