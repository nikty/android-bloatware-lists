    The UAF Authenticator-Specific Module (ASM) is a software interface on top of UAF authenticators which gives a standardized way for FIDO UAF clients to detect and access the functionality of UAF authenticators and hides internal communication complexity from FIDO UAF Client.

    This provider is only usable by Samsung apps.
    I see a com.android.security.PASSWORD_EXPIRED intent filter in the AndroidManifest so my guess is it handles password policies.
    For example: A policy could force a user to change their password after a certain amount of time. That's a common policy in enterprise work.

    Keystore is a secure place provided by Android to store cryptographic keys and make it more difficult to extract from the device.
    This package is used by enterprise to update certificates on the device.
    NOTE : It allows IT admins to install certificates while the device is still locked. 
    This means certificates can be silently installed into a keystore without any interaction from the device-user.
    It uses the KNOX TIMA (Named Trust-zone-based Integrity Measurement Architecture) that allows storage of keys in the container for certificate signing using the TrustZone hardware platform.[16]

    MLDAP log
    LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol; I don't know what the M means. Mobile?) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an IP network.
    Directory service refers to the collection of software, hardware, and processes that store and organize everyday items and network resources(folders, files, printers, users, groups, devices, telephone numbers...)
    It looks like a database but it's different.
    Directory services excel at fast lookups for rarely changing data (email, username etc...)
    Differences between database and Directory Service : https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/directory-services-vs-rdbms/
    LDAP uses a relatively simple, string-based query to extract information from Active Directory. LDAP can store and extract objects such as usernames and passwords in Active Directory, and share that object data throughout a network. 
    Example of LDAP usage : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/239385/what-is-ldap-used-for/592339
