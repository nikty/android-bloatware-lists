    Always On Display / Ambient Display
    Runs in the background.
    When enabled in settings it shows clock and notifications when you raise the phone or touch the screen.
    This is basically a lower-power lock-screen. It could in theory reduce power draw if you check notifications/clock often as OLED screens draw minimal power showing a mostly black screen(black = pixel off), but in practice the number of times you'll unintentionally trigger it will likely eat up any potential power savings and more. And if your device doesn't have an OLED screen this will draw way more power.
    Most of these power savings could be applied to your standard lock-screen simply by making your background image completely black.

    Audio fidelity improvement from the Swedish company Dirac.
    Attempts to achieve a flat frequency response curve(i.e: fidelity). Should mainly improve speaker fidelity as it can be pre-calculated and stored as a corrective EQ curve, something not possible for most devices connected through the 3.5mm jack; presets only exist for a very limited number of headphones. Change for non-preset 3.5mm jack devices is just a generic EQ curve that could decrease fidelity just as likely as it could increase it.
