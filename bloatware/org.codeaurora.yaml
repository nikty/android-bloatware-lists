    IMS(Ip Multimedia Subsystem) is an open industry standard for voice and multimedia communications over packet-based IP networks (VoLTE/VoIP/Wifi calling).
    Runs in the background as part of the system, with Google's IMS(com.google.android.ims, "Carrier Services") disabled, I haven't checked if it'd run with Carrier Services enabled.
