    Used to send AT command messages from/to the modem
    Attention commands commands are a collection of short-string commands developed in the early 1980s 
    that were designed to be transmitted via phone lines and control modems. Different AT command strings can be merged together 
    to tell a modem to dial, hang up, or change connection parameters. 
    Smartphones include a basic modem component inside them, which allows the smartphone to connect to the Internet 
    via its telephony function.
    This can be abused. It's been known for many years that Android devices are vulnerable to attacks carried out via AT commands:

    Content Adaptative Backlight Settings
    CABL will try to adjust the image being displaye by changing the contrast/quality/image backlight depending on 
    the content on the screen.
    Downside to this is loss of dynamic range which results in some colors being washed out/clipped.
    CABL != Auto brightness (which doesn't change the content of the screen, only the brightness)
    NOTE: You may want to remove this. It does not work very well on many phones

    Runs on boot, but not in the background beyond that?
    Adds support for eMBMS(evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service), also known as: LTE Broadcast
    Enables carriers to send content using multicast/broadcast (same content to many users at the same time) instead of unicast(to a single user).
    It's a more efficient use of network resources compared to users receiving the same content individually.
    Probably safe to disable if you don't care about multi/broad-casts.
