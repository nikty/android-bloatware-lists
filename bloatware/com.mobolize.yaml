    Secure Wifi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobolize.sprint.securewifi)
    Sprint VPN app provided by Mobolize. You need to pay for using it.
    You'd better use a reliable third-party VPN if you really need to use one.
    This one runs in background all time and every time it sees a "unsecured network" it will popup to encourage you to pay for this VPN.
