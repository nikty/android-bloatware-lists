    Xiaomi Analytics
    This app is shady. According to a guy who tried to reverse engineer the app, Xiaomi Analytics can replace any (signed?) package 
    they want silently on your device within 24 hours. Maybe that no longer the case now but... you don't want analytics anyway.

    NOTE: uninstalling this package causes the Settings app to crash when searching in Settings, so better disable this app instead.
    If you want to test, disable this app and open an issue if anything isn't working. Another weird thing is normal user can disable this app using hidden Settings to manage app by in Google Play.

    WMService
    Runs at boot and has access to internet + GPS
    I quickly looked at the decompiled code and saw some unsanitized SQL inputs, which is BAD! (vulnerable to SQL injection)
    Tries to get your android unique Google advertising ID from Google Play Services.
    Feeds and launches the spying/analytics app "com.miui.hybrid".
    Doesn't seem to do anything important, only tracking.
    WARNING:  It does not seem to affect any functionality or cause bootloop.

    Mi Secure sharing
    Provides an option in the settings of the Xiaomi Gallery to automatically remove location and metadata from images 
    you want to share. This do not remove metadata of the picture in the gallery but only the shared copy.
    There's also a "Secure sharing" watermark that shows up when you share photos on WeChat without metadata.
    The question is does this really remove all EXIF tags? Can someone test?
    This is a useful app anyway but do not forget that all your photos/vidoes taken with the Xiaomi camera are still geo-tagged 
    (+ all others exif tags) by default. 
    What you can do is at least revoke the GPS permission to the camera.
    FOSS alternative to this app :
