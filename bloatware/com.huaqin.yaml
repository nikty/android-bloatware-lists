    Hidden test app (dial *#*#64663#*#*)
    Used by technician in factory to test the hardware. Not intented to be run by end-users. 
    Has a huge amount of permissions.
    A vulnerability was found in 2019 (CVE-2019-15340) allowing any app co-located on the device to 
    programmatically disable and enable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS silently (and without the corresponding access permission)

    SetTransmitPower
    I can't access the apk but I'm pretty sure it is another hidden test app not meant to be used by end-user
    Given its name it could be used to adjust the transmit power of the cell phone antennas
    SAR = Specific Absorption Rate (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_absorption_rate)
    XDA users removed this without any issues. To be 100% sure it would be good to test the SAR without this package (just in case)
