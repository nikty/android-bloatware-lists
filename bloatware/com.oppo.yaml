    Oppo WebView enables Android apps to display web content within the app itself, based on Chrome.
    No root? Don't uninstall.
    Root? If you delete WebView, make sure to install a replacement.
    Many third-party apps, such as banks, VPNs, GitHub, Discord and Reddit use web-based content and will crash without it.
