    Home Layout
    Sets the default MIUI launcher to global layout instead of Chinese (or HyperOS) when you first launch the app or when cleaning the launcher data.
    After removing this app there are several replacement widgets and no phone/message at the bottom.
    Because Chinese MUI uses other apps and package names instead of just changing the default layout in the MIUI launcher code, they just threw the app in.
