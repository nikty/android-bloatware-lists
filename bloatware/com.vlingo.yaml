    Vlingo : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlingo
    FYI : In January 2012 AndroidPit discovered that Vlingo sent packets of information containing the users GPS co-ordinates,
    IMEI (unique device identifier), contact list and the title of every song stored on the device back to Nuance without.
