    I found only: DCF Allows an application to share content using Bluetooth.
    The application is only allowed to broadcast the content as it already has access to remote devices. These things are not available for users.
    Qualcomm only said these things, but where is the code?
    This app is without code so it's safe to remove.

    Qualcomm Display Color Management tool
    Attempts to "make colors look vibrant and true to life". No idea if it actually does something useful or if it's only some garbage dynamic color tuning (they tend to destroy colors).
    Contains a service, but I've never seen it run on my Oneplus 9. Could be tied to color "improvement" settings in Settings->Display (all of which are off for me).
