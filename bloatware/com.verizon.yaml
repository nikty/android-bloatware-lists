    It's a set of metrics-related modules. Google Play uses the version of the Telemetry module to determine
    if updates are available for metrics-related modules and which security patch version to display to the end user. 
    This module doesnâ€™t contain active code and has no functionality on its own. 
    Removing modules-related packages may not be safe since Android 11

    DMAT Account ? It is used to hold shares and securities in dematerialised/electronic format.
    Seems weird that Verizon provide this so it's likely not this.
