    GCUV
    Not 100% sure but @siraltus from XDA thinks it refers to "Gauce Components" which seems to be the LG's version of CSC 
    (carrier sales code - automatic carrier-specific customization).
    It gets run on first boot after factory reset, sets up the ROM features based on which carrier and country code is specified 
    in the build.prop, and then gets frozen so it doesn't reconfigure things on subsequent boots.
    It's basically the only person to mention "Gauce components" on the web (other than restricted LG webpages when using Google dorks).

    SmartShare 
    Feature that uses DLNA technology to stream multimedia contents between DLNA devices.

    It’s much like instapaper or pocket app, but it works locally, like reading mode on some browsers, saving only the body of the article.
