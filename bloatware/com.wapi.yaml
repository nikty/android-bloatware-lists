    A Chinese national standard for Wireless LAN within a limited area such as a home. Not very useful if you don't live in China.

    Digital certificates identify devices and apps for security. Just like your driverâ€™s license shows that you can legally drive, a digital certificate identifies your device and confirms that it should be able to access something.
