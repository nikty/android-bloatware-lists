    Advanced Logging
    Sends logs to Sony Mobile. These logs contain a wide range of personal information such as unique device IDs, your location, 
    details regarding running applications, and events/input leading up to a crash.
    Logging is only active for a short time and automatically disabled once logging has been completed. 
    Logs are uploaded when connected to Wi-Fi and automatically deleted when the upload is complete.

    Aptx Notifier
    aptX (formerly apt-X) is a family of proprietary audio codec compression algorithms owned by Qualcomm.
    If you don't mind closed source codec, aptX has lower latency and is less of a drain on your battery than default codec (AAC)
    This package is used to display a notification when a device using aptX (bluetooth headphone typically) is connected.
    Its only use is to tell you that you use aptX bluetooth with the connected device.

    Cell information
    Cell broadcast is designed to deliver messages to multiple users in an area.
    This is notably used by ISP to send Emergency/Government alerts.

    I think this package only handles notifications for broadcasts, not the implementation.
    It seems like broadcast SMS use normal notifications so there is a chance this package provides special notification for Sony SMS app?

    Xperia Intelligence Engine
    This app is supposed to understand how you use the phone, the apps you prefer, and will suggest tips 
    and options based on app usage, how often you use an app, what time of day...
    For me this just looks like a AI bullshit app who has a huge list of permissions and launch in background at boot
    This app performs geofencing (check if your are located in a certain perimeter, near your home for instance)

    Cell signal is similar as before, also calls, SMSs and mobile data. I think it is not worth having this package installed because it uses a lot of wakelock time, but I cannot see any cell signal drop since I uninstalled it.
    In the code found some things: omadm, wifi calling, IMS. Its app for dual SIM reachability? Not sure if its app for debugging.
