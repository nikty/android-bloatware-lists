    Mediatek Network Location Provider
    Provides periodic reports on the geographical location of the device. Each provider has a set of criteria under which it may be used. For example, some providers require GPS hardware and visibility to a number of satellites, while others require the use of the cellular radio, or access to a specific carrier's network, or to the internet.
    I don't understand why this is needed; there already is one in 'com.google.android.gms'
    I wonder if NLP can be replaced by https://github.com/microg/UnifiedNlp
    I suggest testing if you get a better signal/battery performance with Mediatek NLP on or off.

    omacp = OMA Client Provisioning. A protocol specified by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA).
    Configuration messages parser. Used for provisioning APN settings to devices via SMS.
    In my case, it was automatic and I never needed configuration messages.
    Maybe it's useful if carriers change their APN. But you can still change the config manually, it's not difficult.
    Dunno why Mediatek handles this kind of things. Safe to remove. At worst, you'll need to manually config your APN.
    OMACP can be abused:
