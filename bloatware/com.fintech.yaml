    Chinese app that spoofs as a Singapore financial and/or payment app to show advertisement notifications (mostly loans)
    It accesses locations, contacts, camera, mic by default, some people in Thailand also reported that they cannot use legitimate regional banking apps until this app was disabled or uninstalled with ADB method. While newer devices that start with Oppo ColorOS 13 and/or Realme UI 4 (around Android 13) are already baked in, it seems likely that it comes with a system update at older devices of those brands, so this is shady and constantly lost trust from many users.
