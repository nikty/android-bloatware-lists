    Wireless emergency alerts
    Cell broadcast is designed to deliver messages to multiple users in an area.

    Overlays work by mapping resources defined in the overlay package to resources defined in the target package. When an app attempts to resolve the value of a resource in the target package, the value of the overlay resource the target resource is mapped to is returned instead.
    The CellBroadcastReceiver app is a default system app that handles emergency and nonemergency alerts (such as amber and presidential alerts) and presents the information to end users based on carrier and regional regulations.

    The CellBroadcastService service supports CellBroadcast SMS decoding, geofencing for wireless emergency alert (WEA) 3.0, message duplication checks, and broadcasting messages to apps. It's a one-to-many geotargeted and geofenced messaging service designed to deliver messages to multiple mobile phone users, in a defined area, at the same time.

    The ExtServices module updates framework components for core OS functionality such as notification ranking, autofill text-matching strategies, storage cache, package watchdog, and other services that run continually. This module is updatable, meaning it can receive updates to functionality outside of the normal Android release cycle.
    Can run before the user unlocks the device (direct-boot aware) and Android 9+ version have internet and location permissions.
    
    WARNING: Causes bootloop on most Android 11+ phones. This module is related to the Android mainline project (which is a useful project).There is no reason to mess with this.

    Google Play Services
    GMS = Google Mobile Services.
    It is a layer that sits on top of the OS and provides a lot of proprietary Google APIs, giving apps access to various Google Services, such as: "fused"-location (internet and GPS chip), QR Code scanner, 2FA, G-Drive storage, Firebase API, Cloud Messaging, etc...
    If you remove it, all the apps relying on it will either:
    - detect the lack of Play-Services and refuse to run
    - detect the lack of Play-Services but allow you to run (improperly) by dismissing an annoying popup
    Removing Google Play Services can boot-loop some devices, so be careful.
    Disabling this package will improve battery life significantly, as it always runs in the background.
    IMPORTANT: You need to uncheck "Find My Device" from the "Device admin apps" settings panel to be able to disable this package.
    Search "admin" in the Settings-app search bar, or go to the Security category.

    Google package installer. Seems to replace com.android.packageinstaller on newer phones. It is strangely not needed on older devices (you can still install APKs without it by using the AOSP package installer) but since Android 9, it also handles permissions control and could bootloop your device if removed.
    On Android 8.1, disabling the app also disabled the 'Permissions' settings within all the apps. Besides that, I couldn't install an '.apk' file download from outside the Play Store.

Open-source TTS engines available on Android exists but, as of the end of 2022, there is only RHVoice (https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.olga_yakovleva.rhvoice.android/) and it doesn't support a lot of languages.
