    OnePlus Common Log Tool
    9 permissions and given what we know about OnePlus logging apps, it's a good idea to disable this.
    See com.oneplus.opbugreportlite, com.oem.oemlogkit and net.oneplus.odm

    Literally just their forum... in an app.

    Oneplus Launcher
    Runs in the background as part of the system.
    Aside from obviously handling the default launcher itself, it also handles the Recents UI on Android 9, the home&recents gestures in Android 11, some submenus in the Settings app and possibly more that I'm unaware of.
    Probably not a good idea to disable.

    "OnePlus System Service"
    Shady telemetry app.
    Sends loads of data to OnePlus' servers, including IMEI, phone number, MAC addresses, mobile network names and IMSI prefixes, Wi-Fi connection info, the phone's serial number and every time an app was opened.

    Insight Provider
    Provider for net.oneplus.odm? (shady telemetry app)
    Content providers encapsulate data, providing centralized management of data shared between apps.

    AppCategoryProvider
    Runs in the background.
    I think this categorizes apps for use with system functionality, for example: automatically adding games to Game Mode.

    Push
    OnePlus push notifications.
    Only used by OnePlus' pre-installed apps. Pushes "surveys and other junk" according to a user.

    OnePlus can remotely send push notifications:

    OnePlus Weather (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.oneplus.weather)
    Occasionally runs in the background; I think it runs every now and then to change the app icon to current weather conditions.
